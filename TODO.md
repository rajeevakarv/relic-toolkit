## Current tasks before next release ##

  * Find a solution for const-correct extension field arithmetic (structs?)
  * Carefully review RSA padding code, check length when digestInfo needs to be inserted and make padding scheme decided on runtime.
  * Implement HMAC-DRBG when HMAC is considered stable.
